# Plugin for OctoPrint - saves filename, print time and filament usage for each print

![PrintHistory](printhistory.png?raw=true) 

## Setup

Install the plugin like you would install any regular Python package from source:

    pip install https://github.com/imrahil/OctoPrint-PrintHistoryPlugin/archive/master.zip
    
Make sure you use the same Python environment that you installed OctoPrint under, otherwise the plugin
won't be able to satisfy its dependencies.

Restart OctoPrint.
